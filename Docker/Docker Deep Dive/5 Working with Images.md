# 5 Working With Images

## Images: The Big Picture

Image == Stopped Container

docker image pull

## Images in Detail

Image is not a single BLOB !

It has different Layers connected per manifest

get the manifest => Pull the layers

## Registries

Docker Trusted Registry (DTR)

**Directories**

/varlib/docker/\<storage-driver>  
C:\ProgramData\docker\windowsfilter

**Distribution hashes vs Content Hashes vs Random Hashes in Filesystem**

## Best Practices

*   Use official Images 
*   Smaller is Better
*   Explicit referencing Images (not latest)
