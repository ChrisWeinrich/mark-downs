# 2 What is rest

## HTTP in a Nutshell

Request: verb,headers,content
Response: status code,header,content

Stateless

### Request

verb => Action perform on server: get,post,put,patch,delete, ...  
header => Metadata: Content Type, Content Length, Authorization, Accept,Cookies ...  
content => Anything, not every verb has content !

### Response

Status code => Operation Status
Headers => Metadata 
content => Anything

## What is REST

### Representational State Transfer
*   Seperation of client and Server
*   Server Requests are stateless
*   Cacheable Requests
*   Uniform Interfaces

### Problems
* Dogma
* Structured architectural style

## Well designed API
