# Looking Forward to Further Enhancements

## Always Valid vs not Always Valid

*   Always Valid: Don't worry about Validation
*   Not Always Valid : Validation in central place

=> Always Valid  preferred
*   Better Dry
*   Remove temporal Coupling
*   Classes maintain there invariants
*   Fail Fast

Validation in Application Services

## Factories

*   Create of Domain Entities
*   Don't use for simple creation logic

## Domain Services vs Application Services
*   Domain Service: Inside Domain Layer,Don't have state,Contain domain logic
*   Application Service: Outside of the domain layer,communication with outside world, No Domain Logic

## Anemic Domain Model Anti-pattern

Separating Data and Logic

Poor Encapsulation

## Flat Entities Anti Pattern

Too Much logic in entities
Unnatural Responsibilities
Look up data in external sources
Communicate with external layers

## Repository Anti Pattern

*   Do Not return partially Initialized entities !
*   Create DtoS For partially Initialized Entities 

## Mechanical Approach to DDD Anti Pattern

YAGNI

## Further Enhancements
