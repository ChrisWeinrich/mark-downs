## Refactoring Guidelines

Not all code is worth being refactored
Be Strategic, only apply where new Functionality is implemented

**Legacy Code Base**

Domain or Problem Domain => Problem the Software is solving

## Outlining new Domain Model

## Creating the Bubble Context

Own Project
As Little new code as possible, only use the information which are needed 

## Translation Map

Translation on Data Level is the Best !

## Identifying the Entry Point
